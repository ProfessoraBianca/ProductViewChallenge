## My process

Hello again!  üëã

This project was built using display `flex`, **BUT:**

At first I tried to do it with the `grid` display, creating 2 columns and 6 rows.

| image colum | text colum|
|-------------|-----------|
| image       | text1     |
| image       | text2     |
| image       | text3     |
| image       | text4     |
| image       | text5     |


Then I had a lot of dificulty organizing and managing the texts through the rows of the `grid`. 

It felt too *complex* for something that could be *easily* achieved by using `flex`.

Also, it took me a while to get the `<picture>` element to work properly.

As you can probably see, the image has a fixed `width` in CSS. This makes the *responsiveness* **not work** well. 

**The problem:** When I tried using `%` or `rem` , the image would either get too large or too small, never the size I needed. 
  
  ***Cool Stuff:*** I added some animations beyond just the color change of the `<button>`. Feel free to explore and find out what I did ! üòÅ

**Some questions:**

-   Is flex really the best option here?
    
-   How can I better fit the image so that responsiveness works?
    
-   When I added the animation to the price, the `<span>` was also animated, and I couldn't make it stop. Any advice?
